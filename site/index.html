            enemies blind, teleports across the
            field, then lets paranoia take hold as foes scramble to uncover where it might strike next.

            A man with mysterious origins, Omen is focused on hindering the vision of his enemies with things like an
            orb
            that strikes those in his sights with nearsightedness and another that bursts to obscure the vision of
            everyone
            nearby. He can also teleport a short distance, or use his ultimate to teleport anywhere on the map as a
            shadow

            Prior to the global launch of Valorant and the end of the Closed Beta, Omen originally had sharp light blue
            eyes, rather than the current triple vertical slashes on his "face".

    <div class="text" style="color: red;">v0.50</div>

    <div class="text">
        Dark Cover smoke duration increased 12 >> 15 seconds.
        Dark Cover smoke projectile speed increased.
        Dark Cover cooldown increased 30 >> 35 seconds.
        Especially at high-tier play, we’ve seen Brimstone become the dominant controller and we wanted to give his
        peers a boost to make them more viable while hopefully maintaining their unique playstyles.

        Omen now immediately becomes vulnerable and no longer appears dark after he leaves his alternate shadow form.
        If you were to find enemy Omen teleporting in, it was often confusing when you should shoot him to get the kill
        (vs. sending him back). This change is to both account for an invulnerability bug and score some extra points of
        clarity.
        The attenuation radius of the arrival sound on Omen's From the Shadows has been reduced to 2250
        Attenuation is a big word, but the short of it is you have to be closer to Omen to echolocate where he’s
        teleporting to. We’re trying to give him some spook back since if you do find him, you should now have him dead
        to rights.
